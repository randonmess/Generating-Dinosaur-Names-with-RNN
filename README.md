# Generating-Dinosaur-Names-with-RNN
Using the RNN from **Building an RNN**, a character-level language model was implemented to generate dinosaur names

## Objectives
* Store text data for processing using an RNN 
* Build a character-level text generation model using an RNN
* Sample novel sequences in an RNN
* Explain the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in RNNs
* Apply gradient clipping as a solution for exploding gradients
